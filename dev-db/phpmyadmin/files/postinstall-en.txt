If this is a new installation:

1. Configure ${PN}:

a) Create config.inc.php. You can use the web-based installer
   (this requires the 'setup' USE flag to be enabled):

   mkdir ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config
   chown ${VHOST_SERVER_UID}:${VHOST_SERVER_UID} ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config

   Then go to http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/setup/

   Once you've saved the configuration:

   cp ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config/config.inc.php ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config.inc.php
   rm -rf ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config
   
   You might want to use the web-based installer only once for initial setup.
   Since the setup tool was the target of various exploits in the past, you
   might want to remove or lock it once you have generated this initial config.
   I recommend to generate a '.htaccess' file in ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/setup/
   (you have to have the proper AllowOverride - settings for this folder which
   allows this) or even delete that folder completely.

b) Alternatively, use an existing configuration:

   cp <path to existing config.inc.php file> ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/

c) Alternatively, use the sample config file:

   cp ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config.sample.inc.php ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config.inc.php

2. Be sure that the libraries/ directory is not visible. You can use the
   provided .htaccess file.

=================================================================

If you are upgrading from an earlier version:

1. If you are using ${PN}'s features for master/foreign tables, be sure to read
   http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/Documentation.html#col_com

   You will need to perform the ALTER TABLE step yourself.
